## 2025-10-25

✅ Created first public lab repo  
✅ Learned how GitHub folders, commits, and Markdown work  
✅ Practiced `ls`, `cd`, `rm`, `kill`, `cat`, `chmod`  
✅ Logged activity like a real security analyst  
✅ Shifted mindset: I don’t need permission to get experience  
✅ Documented everything cleanly like I would on the job
