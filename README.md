# Hacknet to Cloud Skills: My Cybersecurity Simulation Lab

This repo documents my hands-on learning journey using **Hacknet**, **Linux**, and **cloud tools** to build real-world cybersecurity and IAM (Identity & Access Management) skills.

I'm reverse-engineering what I learn in the simulation and applying it to:
- Linux/Bash commands
- IAM roles and cloud architecture
- Privilege escalation and incident response
- Security logging and access analysis

## 🛠️ How I Use This Repo

Each entry in the `logs/` folder includes:
- 🧠 What I learned in Hacknet
- 💻 Equivalent real-world Linux or AWS command
- 🧪 Notes from testing on EC2 or local VM
- 🔐 How this maps to IAM or security workflows

## 💬 Why I'm Doing This

I wanted **real experience**, not just certificates.

Hacknet is helping me build:
- Command-line speed and accuracy
- Security-first thinking
- Confidence under pressure
- Understanding of how access systems work (and break)

---

## 🧠 Goals

- Reach proficiency in Bash/Linux
- Practice IAM and security workflows on AWS
- Create projects that show I can think and act like a real cloud security engineer
