# Hacknet to Real Linux Mapping

| Hacknet Skill        | Real Command / Concept     | Notes |
|----------------------|----------------------------|-------|
| File navigation      | `cd`, `ls`                 | Used daily |
| File deletion        | `rm`                       | Use with caution |
| Killing processes    | `kill`, `kill -9`          | `ps aux` to view PIDs |
| Permissions          | `chmod`, `chown`           | `chmod 755 script.sh` |
| Shell injection      | `shell`, `bash`            | You’ll use this in EC2 |
| File viewing         | `cat`, `less`, `nano`      | Good for log analysis |
| Cracking/ports       | `nmap` *(coming soon)*     | Real port scanning |

## Why This Matters:
If I can beat a Hacknet mission, I should ask:  
> “How would I do this in real life using Linux or AWS tools?”
